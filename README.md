# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website. It is a curated space to showcase my work, skills, and creative journey as a front-end developer. Built with modern tools, smooth animations, and a focus on responsive design.

> Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed via **Vercel**.
